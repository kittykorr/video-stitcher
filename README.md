# video-stitcher
This was a project intended to cut segments of randomly selected video from folder, then stitch them together for automated compilation generation. Does not fully function. I gave up on this one because the selection and cutting part works fine, and I enjoy the process of video editing, myself.

Dependent on FFMPEG.

Simply change input folder and output folder to desired paths.

Run the .bat, powershell commands wil execute and automate the process.

May need further tinkering to actually stitch the videos.

Good luck, and have fun kitties.
